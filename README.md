DIABETES DETECTION USING NEURAL NETWORKS
Objective:
This is a simple binary classification problem to detect an onset of diabetes. This is my first project to use neural network in Keras.

Data:
Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Dataset

In this Keras project, I am using the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset. It describes patient medical record data for Pima Indians and whether they had an onset of diabetes within five years.

Steps to take:
Load Data.
Define Keras Model.
Compile Keras Model.
Fit Keras Model.
Evaluate Keras Model.
Make Predictions.
